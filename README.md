# The NIST SPeech HEader REsources (SPHERE) Package

Version 2.6

For a description of SPHERE, read the files, 'doc/sphere.rdm' and
'doc/sphere.doc'.  UNIX-style man pages can be found in 'doc/man'.

If you're linking the sphere library with code written for SPHERE
version 2.0 or 2.1, the argument calls for sp_read_data and
sp_write_data have changed.  Section VI, "Linking to the SPHERE
library" in the document "doc/sphere.doc" describe ways to use the old
code without re-writing it.
